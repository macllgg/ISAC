                            Rhetorical Analysis of Hidden Intellectualism
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            “Hidden Intellectualism” is the article written by Gerald Graff. He wrote very impressive arguments in this article. Most of the arguments he made are from his personal experience. He almost immediately reveals the main argument at the beginning of the article. He describes how street smart, a kid who might not be good in academics but maybe knowing other good skills or knowledge is not less than the one who is academically smart. As Graff puts it, “we associate the educated life, the life of the mind, too narrowly exclusive with subjects and texts that we consider inherently weighty and academic,” (Graff 2), By this, he simply states that street smart is too often overlooked in schools and colleges because the education system sees them as anti-intellectual.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The story begins with the struggle faced by modern young persons. Some of them are street smart failing in schools but are good other than that. The author then describes a piece of his "anti-intellectual" childhood which explains how his interest in sports played important role in shaping his academic life. He grew up in Chicago and when he was in primary school, he was never interested in reading books provided to him in class instead, he was more interested in reading sports illustrated magazines and other sports articles. According to him, it really helped him to improve his skills and knowledge in sports-related activities. Graff built this argument using proper structure and tactics due to which the point he wanted to make to the audience came out precisely. The whole article is long but written in a conversational tone which keeps readers engaged in the story without getting bored. Graff gave decent information about his past experiences in order to provide support to his stance “Though I too thought I didn't 'did the intellectual bit', I see now that I was unwittingly in training for it... I was practicing being an intellectual before I knew what I wanted to be". (Graff 9)

                        <p>
                            He also makes an argument that “schools and colleges might be at fault for missing the opportunity to tap into street smarts and channel them into good academic work” (Graff1). According to him, some people think that the only people who have knowledge about Shakespeare, Plato, Nuclear Fission, French Revolution are intellectual and those who understand dating, TV, fashion, sports, and video games are not intellectual.

                            According to me, the article has both positive and negative aspects. The main argument is pretty solid and clearly delivers his thoughts to the readers. Also, the logic is straight to the point without any gaps in it. But I think he didn’t give a proper conclusion to the writing. He keeps informing us about something we already know again and again and does not provide any solution to it. Apart from that, he is successful in describing what is going on inside his mind.

                            Graff is targeting education boards, schools, and college faculties for not providing students a chance to learn things that they are interested in. He seems to show some frustration towards the way he was being taught in the school According to him, the schools and colleges are missing opportunities to understand students' intelligence and skills which can be helpful for grasping things into their heads easily and make them more engaged towards academics. He looks sarcastic and provided rhetorical techniques to support his argument that if educational institutes will provide students a chance to learn their choice of interest along with academics, then they would surely develop both their complex thinking and writing skills even though they might not be smart enough in academics.

                            Graff grew up in Chicago post world war 2. He used to live near a place where the middle class and jobless people were just a few blocks away from it. “I was desperate for the approval of the hoods, which I encountered daily on the playing field in the neighborhood, and for this purpose, it was not all good to be book smart.”(Graff 6) The people of the hood were so jealous of the book-smart people that they were always harassing them. Graff grew up in a situation between the need to prove his smartness as well as fear of beating if he proves it too well.

                            There are no typical rules about the style and the structure. The essay has to be more than 150 words. It should be unique and unusual.
